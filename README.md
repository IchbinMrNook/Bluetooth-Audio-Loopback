# Bluetooth Audio Loopback 🔁
A simple Android app that enables Bluetooth microphone-to-speaker loopback audio in real-time.

📲 Features:
🔄 Real-time Bluetooth audio loopback

🛠️ Easy-to-use interface

⚙️ Installation:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/IchbinMrNook/Bluetooth-Audio-Loopback.git

Open and build the project in Android Studio

🚀 Usage:
1. Launch the app
2. Connect your Bluetooth headphones to your phone
3. Click "Start"
4. **Done!**

📲 Use Case:
Imagine two people, each wearing one earbud (Person 1 with earbud A and Person 2 with earbud B). When the app is opened and "Start" is clicked, the microphone on each earbud picks up the user's voice and plays it back through both earbuds with a slight delay (about 50ms). This creates a fun, movie-like effect where each person hears eachothers voice in real-time! 🎤🎧
Now just move about 10 meters away from each other and talk. This also works trough walls. 🎤🔊
